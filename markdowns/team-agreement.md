# Team Agreement

### Communication Plan
* How will your group communicate with each other?
  * Will utilize various messaging services for communication when not with each other - Chime and Slack.
  * Will utilize Trello to update topics and boards with ideas, suggestions, and potential pinch points to ensure clear communication and documentation is maintained.
* How will you ensure that everyone’s voice is heard?
  * Will follow the conflict resolution to ensure that everyone is able to openly and freely speak their minds.
  * We will use I statements and constructive comments/criticism to aid each other in understanding and avoiding problems.
  * We will utilize a conflict circle if we need to resolve issues and ensure all members can speak openly and actively.
* How will you manage psychological safety?
  * Take appropriate breaks when needed.
  * Ensure all members feel respected and valued by the use of an I statement and constructive comments/criticisms.

### Conflict Plan:
* What will our group do when it encounters conflict?
  * As a group we will put any conflicting idea to a vote.
  * One person will be randomly selected each day (changes every day) to have a double vote. This will ensure all ties are broken.
  * If the vote is unable to solve the issue, we will move into a Conflict Resolution Circle.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * We will address our concerns in our end-of-day standup. This will ensure all concerns are voiced without instructor involvement.
  * Concerns will be raised in the beginning-of-day standup if the same issue becomes necessary to express to the instructor team.
  * We will start all conflict problems from a place of support and we will express our intentions with a whole message - this will help to reduce unnecessary friction if a conflict arises.
  * We will attempt to only use I statements when approaching a conflict.
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  * We will ensure all members are fed and sufficiently watered.
  * We will allow members to take reasonably timed breaks.
  * We will create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard, valued, and respected.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  * If we are unable to solve our conflict through a vote we will escalate to a Conflict Resolution Circle. If a circle is called we will all:
    * close our laptops.
    * use a "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed.
    * continue to follow all rules laid down previously to ensure ONLY appropriate and constructive comments are made.
    * when circle ends, the issue is CLOSED and the resolution is complete.
    * If the Conflict Resolution Circle is unable to solve the issue, or the issue persists passed a Conflict Resolution Circle, we will bring the issue to Michelle.

### Work Plan:
* We will use a Trello Board to keep track of tasks and who is working on what at the beginning of each day
* Code reviews will be done at the end of the day
* Enforce a 15 minute rule - if a task is too difficult and the person is struggling for more than 15 minuntes, then they should pair up or ask for help.

### Git Process:
* The repo will be set to push to a “dev” branch as the standard push - “master” will only be used for deployable and tested features. This will ensure that only completed features will be added to the master and the application will not crash with “test” features.
* All branches will be appropriately named - styled as “{first initial}{last initial}_{feature}”
  * Ex: np_ApplicationUser
* All members will push working branches to the repo at the end of each working day - they will be merged as a group to ensure merge conflicts can be resolved.
* All merge requests will require one other member to review before it can be merged into the dev branch
* All master branch merges will require the entire team to review before merging.
